# robotree
NOTE: I was not able to get a working Makefile for the FLTK program, however it does run using xcode project file. If it still does not run I can come by your office to compile and run the GUI.

The guide below gives full instructions on the functionality of the entire robotree program.

Robotree Quick Start Guide:
  1) Open the xcode project file
  2) Build and run the project via xcode
  3) Navigate to "File>Populate Fields" (This will create generic arm, head, torso, locomotor, and battery parts as well as generic customer and sales associates)
  4) Navigate to "Create>Robot Models" and build a model from the generic parts that were created with Populate Fields
  5) Navigate to "Report>Model" (Here you can view all current models)
  6) Navigate to "Create>Order" and create an order from the new model that was just created and the generic customers and sales associates
  7) Navigate to "Report>Orders" (Here you can view all current orders)
